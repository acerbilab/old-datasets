# Old computational cognitive science datasets

This repo contains datasets of computational cognitive science papers published pre-2018. In particular:

1. `acerbi2012internal.mat`: Acerbi L, Wolpert DM, Vijayakumar S (2012). Internal Representations of Temporal Statistics and Feedback Calibrate Motor-Sensory Interval Timing. *PLoS Computational Biology* 8(11): e1002771.
2. `acerbi2014origins.mat`: Acerbi L, Vijayakumar S, Wolpert DM (2014). On the Origins of Suboptimality in Human Probabilistic Inference. *PLoS Computational Biology* 10(6): e1003661.

The data are available as MATLAB files. Please consult the original papers for additional information on the meaning of the various fields and experiments, and feel free get in touch with precise questions if you still need help.
